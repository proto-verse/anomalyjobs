# Publication #

> Jobs that are in buckets that are flagged to be Myjobs accessible, or
> jobs in buckets that have been set with the TRANSPARENT attribute can be
> seen with the '+myjobs' command. In the instance where a bucket is set up
> to be transparent, then all jobs in that bucket can be seen by all players
> as if they had opened a request.

> When a user views a job with +myjobs, they see the opening comment and any
> comments they have added. Anyone who can access the bucket can use the
> following commands:
```
  +job/publish <#>=<Comment#>  Publish an individual comment.
  +job/publish <#>             Publish a whole job.
```
> Both of these commands toggle the publication status of the item - to
> unpublish a comment simply repeat the command on it.

> A job can only be published if it is in a Myjobs accessible bucket. In
> the default view of a job, a + or - shows whether or not a comment is
> published.

> If you publish a whole job, this overrides any individually published
> comments. You cannot 'unpublish' a comment on a published job. If you wish
> to selectively publish comments, you'll have to turn off the job's
> publication status.

> As you can see, the use of publication can be a powerful communications tool
> for players and staff, and you should see the importance of maintaining a
> professional presence when dealing with Myjobs buckets. It is also important
> to review all comments that are going to be published very carefully for
> any information that would be untoward if released.

> If you /tag a job for a player, they can see the whole job no matter the
> publication status, and no matter where the job is located.

> By default, +job/mail will set the @mail'd comment published.

> You can change the source (Opened By) of a job to a list of many players
> which will effectively turn it into a group job. Jobs opened using
> +job/query defaults to setting the Opened By to the queried players and
> automatically assigns the job to the command enactor.

> By default, the PUB bucket is the only bucket that is set transparent.
