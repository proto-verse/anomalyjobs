# Tagging #
```
  +job/tag <#>
  +job/tag <#>=<player list>
```
> The /tag command tags a job for you to watch. Tagged jobs will show up on
> your +jobs/mine list (or `<player>`'s list), even if it is not assigned to
> you.

```
  +job/untag <#>
  +job/untag <#>=<player list>
```
> This will untag a job from the watch list, for yourself in the first
> instance and for `<player list>` in the second.

> If you tag a job to a player that does not have access to the jobs system,
> then the job will show up in +myjobs, and they will have FULL ACCESS to that
> job (IE, they will be able to read all entries, and they will be able to add
> to that job), no matter if the job is in a public bucket or not.
